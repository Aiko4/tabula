# Background
Detection and quantification of material and cultural variations in time and space are two key methodological issues in archaeology. Whether for intrasite or regional investigations, these issues require the construction of reliable chronologies and the quantitative description of archaeological assemblages (i. e. archaeological sites or intrasite units, each described as a set of $p$ types of objects).

Building chronologies involve distinguishing between relative (that provide only a chronological sequence) and absolute dating methods (that yield a calendric indication) [@obrien2002]. Among the relative dating methods, matrix seriation is a long-established method in archaeology since its first formulation by @petrie1899 and has allowed the construction of reference chronologies [@ihm2005]. For a set $X$ of $n$ archaeological assemblages, the seriation problem comes down to discovering on $X$ an order inferred as chronological. This approach relies on a set of well-defined statistical and archaeological assumptions [@dunnell1970] and the use of *a priori* information (e. g. absolute dates or stratigraphical constraints: @poblome2003) allows the analysis of chronological patterns in a socio-economic or cultural perspective (e. g. @bellanger2012, @lipo2015).

The quantitative analysis of archaeological assemblages can thus be carried out in a synchronic (e. g. diversity measurements) or diachronic (e. g. evolutionary studies: selection process, patterns of cultural transmission, etc.) way. These approaches cover a wide range of applications and have led to the development of a multitude of statistical models, but have not been systematically implemented to enable the deployment of reproducible workflows.

# Summary
`tabula` attempts to provide a convenient and reproducible toolkit for analysis, seriation and visualization of archaeological count data (artifacts, faunal remains, etc.).

The package uses a set of S4 classes for archaeological data matrices that extend the basic `matrix` data type. These new classes represent different special types of matrix: incidence, abundance, co-occurrence and (dis)similarity. Methods for a variety of functions applied to objects from these classes provide tools for relative and absolute dating and analysis of (chronological) patterns.

`tabula` includes functions for matrix seriation (`seriate_*`), as well as chronological modeling and dating (`date_*`) of archaeological assemblages and/or objects. Resulting models can be checked for stability and refined with resampling methods (`refine_*`). Estimated dates can then be displayed as tempo or activity plot [@dye2016] to assess rhythms of the long term. Beyond these, `tabula` provides several tests (`test_*`) and measures of diversity within and between archaeological assemblages: heterogeneity and evenness (Brillouin, Shannon, Simpson, etc.), richness and rarefaction (Chao1, Chao2, ACE, ICE, etc.), turnover and similarity (Brainerd-Robinson, etc.). Finally, the package make it easy to visualize count data and statistical thresholds (`plot_*`): rank vs. abundance plots, heatmaps, @ford1962 and @bertin1977 diagrams.

`tabula` is designed to be used both by archaeologists and by students in courses on dating methods and applied statistics in archaeology.
